# SEFE - European Energy Trading Dashboard

European Energy Trading Dashboard Demo — A single-page interactive dashboard built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Simulates live market data using Chart.js. Designed to demonstrate my technical skills, development approach, UI/UX design, and data visualisation methods in the energy trading sector.

## Overview
This project is a demonstration of my technical skillset, methods, design approach, and problem-solving style.  
The dashboard provides a simulated overview of key financial indicators, company information, and market fundamentals relevant to European energy trading.
It is designed to support discussions around innovation in energy markets and explore opportunities to apply data-driven decision-support tools.

##Project
This project showcases an interactive European Energy Trading Dashboard, built entirely in a single HTML file using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Chart.js. 
It simulates real-time market analysis, financial indicators, and company insights in a clean, professional interface.

Designed as a demonstration of my technical expertise, prompt engineering, development approach, and visual design style, the dashboard highlights how data-driven tools can support strategic decision-making in the energy trading sector.

> **Important:** All data and charts are simulated for demonstration purposes only.

## Development Process

### 1. Prompt Ideation
Project initiated via Google AI Studio using the prompt:

> *"Help me to create an interactive ‘European Energy Trading Dashboard’ to help analyse financial data, research companies, and understand market trends."*

### 2. Front-End Build
- Developed as a **single HTML file**.
- CSS and JavaScript embedded directly for simplicity and portability.
- External assets (fonts, Chart.js) loaded via CDN.

### 3. Data Simulation
- Static base values with JavaScript-driven fluctuations to simulate "live" updates.
- Visual indicators (green for up, grey for down) for quick market movement analysis.

### 4. Version Management
- Hosted and maintained on GitHub for easy collaboration, feedback, and deployment.
- Version updates tracked through Git commits and notes.
